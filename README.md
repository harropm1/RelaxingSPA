# Welcome to the SPA Spa

This site, created by Michelle Harrop for HartCode Academy 2019, is a SPA (single page application that lets a visitor to the site search different spa services. It will provide times, prices, and descriptions.

# Site Pages
This site only has one page, but the rest of the features will be dynamically generated. These include:
- search buttons
- a spa service category select
- a list of available spa services
- details about all spa services
- pictures (hopefully)


# Access
After loading the project to your computer, you will need to open the command prompt. You will need to navigate to the folder for this particular project, then type "node server.js". The command prompt should return "App listening at port 8081". From here, you will need to go to http://localhost:8081/index.html to view the project.
